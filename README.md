# SummerBreakGame



This is in early development and needs the server to be running to work.

The game is a driving game so far that is still undergoing changes but this is me wanting to test physics over the network and how it would affect each client as I have never dabbled with the creation of making a game multiplayer before now.

I hope you enjoy what is here at the state it's in, make sure to stay up to date with new releases, this will need to be done manually as there is no automatic updater in place for this game, it's something I will look into and maybe apply to the game but for the meantime you need to download it yourself.
